0.4.5

- Made the 'Reload Popup' button work again
- Added a temporary tooltip to indicate that it may take a couple of clicks for the data to update
- Fixed the personalised Activity data feed so that it actually loads in the background every 10 mins
- Added a tooltip to the icon to tell you some of the core numbers

0.4.4

- Changed fetching News, personal GE and personal Activity data to background tasks
- Re-formatted much of the GE and Activity parsing code
	The above two changes make opening the popup considerably faster by removing the need to make XHRs
	(it's typically 3-5x faster on a slow machine, more on more powerful ones)
- Fixed some uncaught type conversion issues

0.4.3

- Fixed a rounding error with quanities of processed items in the GE
- Added information messages which appear when there's no content in the response from the server
	(too many requests have been made and the user has been blocked)
- Added a feed for the latest RuneScape News, styling it with an Accordion effect
- Created a tabbed interface (Personal, News)
